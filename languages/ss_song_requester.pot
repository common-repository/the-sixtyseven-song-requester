"The sixtyseven song requester plugin was originally created as a tool to "
"manage the song requests on the programmer's wedding. The goal was to give "
"the attending guests a nice way to make a song request to the DJ without "
"even leaving the table. It offers the ability to mark songs as played by the "
"DJ and some basic settings. Everything can be fully achieved in the "
"frontend, so you do not need to give your DJ access to the WordPress admin "
"area, but the plugin has of course the typical admin view of the song "
"requests as well."
